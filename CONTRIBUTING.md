# Contributing

Want to contribute? Here's the process:

Fork and clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/threeSentences.git
```

Setup the app:

```
bundle install
rake db:setup
```

Make sure the tests pass:

```
rake spec
```

Add your changes and tests for them, make sure the tests still pass.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/woolly-bear-caterpillars-2014/threeSentences/compare/).

We'll review your pull request, give you feedback on your commits, and then merge it into the repo when it's ready.
